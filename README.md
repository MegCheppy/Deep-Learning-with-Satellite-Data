# Deep-Learning-with-Satellite-Data

## Part 1
Collection and generation of satellite data, preprocessing, generating masked sarellite image tiles, labels generated from images, using pythong and it's libraries (tensorflow, keras, numpy, openCV )
Output of part 1 is training  and test data which will be used for building deep learning model.

## Part 2.(colab/jupyter notebook)
Performing deep learning using different deep learning models;
- U-net model (encoder and decoder intro)
- Loss functions and metrics explanation.
- Training deep learning model.
- Model history and prediction
- learn how to get activation outputs and gradients for each tf/keras layer.

## Part 3(Advanced concepts)
- ML training diagnostics
- Apply debugging with weights and biases 
- MOdel deployment at Hugging Face space
